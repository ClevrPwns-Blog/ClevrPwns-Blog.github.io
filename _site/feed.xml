One teacher named Mr. Johnson changed that and I’ve been scribbling thoughts, poems and short essays in countless, black 8”x5”, notebooks.

COCAINE NIGHTS

Here I am in the place that I grew.

No matter what I can’t seem to forget you.

I remember that day so vain.

As we dipped into your stash of cocaine.

The bruises on your neck.

The scratches on my back.

All our friends knew,

But we pretended not to.

Now where are we?

I can’t seem to leave it be.

Waking to the sunshine in your bed.

Images forever lingering in my head.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
MANIC DREAMS

I look at my clock and observe the passing of time.

It’s 2am yet I feel so sublime.

I rush up the stairs like a typhoon.

All just to see the moon.

What is this state of being, I can’t quite explain.

An energetic euphoria drenched in physical pain.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Words aren’t real, we just use them to describe things that are.

Love, the Universe, the Sky.

These things are real but the words we use to describe them could never do them justice.

They must be felt not described.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
She doesn’t realize how deeply she makes me feel.  
She’s oblivious to the shifts she causes in my Universe. 
I only wish she could see it as well.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
In this moment I am fine.

I AM HAPPY

SHE IS BEAUTIFUL

SHE IS RADIANT

The world is whole.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The Park 

(this was written from hippy hill in Golden Gate Park
while in the company of some beautifully souled hippies)

Every part of the park is as if it was designed precisely for the psychedelic experience.

The way the paths seem to wander with the breeze. The way the orange and red flowers contrast the earthy greens of the foliage in perfect harmony.

Even the people on the hill seem to have embodied perfection of the set/setting concept.

The massive peace symbol seems to softly whisper that here, you are safe.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
