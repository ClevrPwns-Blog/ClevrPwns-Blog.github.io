I've always been a fan of blogging. I can clearly remember an assignment in my 7th grade english class where we were required to keep a blog, I nearly cried I was so happy that we were actually doing something I cared about. A few day's ago I realized I didn't have a personal website or blog, this felt wrong, so I set out on a mission. I wanted to figure out the cheapest and easiest way to create a beautiful personal site.  I was already familiar with github pages and namecheap had a $0.15 .xyz sale so here we are 15 cents and some Jekyll magic later, I present clevrpwn.xyz.
